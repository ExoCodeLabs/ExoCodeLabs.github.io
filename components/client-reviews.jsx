    review:
      "I had the pleasure of working with Rishi as he led the development of a standalone module within our broader healthcare solution. From the outset, Rishi demonstrated exceptional ownershipâ€”taking full end-to-end responsibility for the project, from architecture through to final release. He consistently brought clarity and transparency, flagging challenges early and providing thoughtful options to address them. His flexibility to learn new technologies and adapt to our evolving needs made him an invaluable asset to our team. Just as important, Rishi approached the work with patience and professionalism, ensuring the final release not only met but exceeded our expectations.I highly recommend Rishi to any team looking to add reliable, skilled, and collaborative technical expertise. He will elevate the quality and execution of any product he supports.",
